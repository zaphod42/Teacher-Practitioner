Lesson 2: Testing a Calculator

In this lesson you are provided with an implementation of a calculator along
with a test suite. The test suite has a failing test already and your first
task is to figure out what is wrong with the calculator and fix the problem to
make the test pass. Once all of the given tests are passing you'll need to
expand the test coverage so that other aspects of the calculator are tested.

== About the calculator ==

The calculator is an of the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) style. This is a
style of calculator that was made popular by the HP48g calculators that I used
when I was in High School. The calculation method is fairly simple and easy to
work with once you get the hang of it. Unlike most calculators in which the
user enters a number, and operation, and another number and then the calculator
either immediately shows the result of that computation or the user presses the
equals key to see the result, RPN calculators use something called a stack to
track operations.

For example, the sequence of keys pressed to add the numbers 12 and 6 in the
two styles is:
  * Standard: 1, 2, +, 6, =
  * RPN: 1, 2, <enter>, 6, +

What happens in an RPN calculator is that every value (i.e. number) is placed
on a stack. Each operation (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.)
removes however many number it requires from the top of the stack, calculates
its result, and then puts its result on the top of the stack.
