These are the lessons for my involvement in Jason Gorman's Teacher-Practitioner
exchange (http://codemanship.co.uk/parlezuml/blog/?postid=1046).

The lessons are aimed at getting the teacher an understanding of programming
and what it takes to create a programmed system. I'm trying to keep each lesson
fun and rewarding in some manner (visual feedback, seeing progress toward a
goal). This is all still very new to me and so any feedback is welcome.

Over time the lesson plan (found in LESSONS) will be updated and my solution
code as well as the lesson code will start to appear in subdirectories.
